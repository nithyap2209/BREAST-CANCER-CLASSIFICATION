Introduction:

This repository contains code for detecting breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which is available in the sklearn.datasets module.

Requirements
* Python 3
* Libraries:
    *pandas
    * numpy
    * scikit-learn
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn
    * plotly
    * mlxtend (for KNN visualization)
      
Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target variable indicates whether the mass is malignant or benign.

Contents
